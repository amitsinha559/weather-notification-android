Weather Notification supports skins from version 0.2.
The skins are separate applications which can display the weather information in different ways and with different styles.

# Why the skins are necessary? #

## Pros ##

### Application size ###

All the numbers with temperature values you see in the notification bar are the images. It's the ugly limitation of the Android platform. The separated image is required for each temperature value and for different screen resolution. The full pack of images takes about 500 Kbytes in the application.

Add here the different colors of the notification bar on different devices. It requires dark and light images.

So in total the 1 Mbyte is required to hold all necessary images. And this Mbyte is just a simple notification. Do you want to install it?

So, the application is splitted into the parts: the core app - 70 Kbytes, and skins - each of 500 Kbytes. It's enough to install only one skin - which is the best for you.

### Install to SD card ###

The Weather Notification cannot be installed to SD card, because of another Android limitation, because it uses the system timer to periodically update the weather information.

But skins can be installed on SD card.

So you should install the core app to the main device memory and heavy skins - to SD card.

### Display other weather conditions ###

Skins can display not only the temperature, but any other available information: wind speed, humidity, etc... You can install more skins and see all necessary additional information in the notification bar.

The skins to display wind speed and humidity will come...

### Third party developers ###

Skins can be created not only by the developers of Weather Notification. Any other developer can create a skin and publish it to Android Market.

Many beautiful skins will come...

Yes, the functionality of the core application should be integrated into Android itself. But, unfortunately, it's not.
